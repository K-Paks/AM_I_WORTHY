# AM_I_WORTHY
A One-shot face recognition system built with OpenCV and PyTorch.

### Project roadmap (TODO):
- [x] Basic Siamese Net working on [AT&T Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces) 
- [x] System connected to my webcam, draws bounding box around my pretty face. 
- [ ] Second net created using transfer learning (model-yet-to-be-chosen) and [vggface2](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face2/).
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning.
